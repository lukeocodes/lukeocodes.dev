## AI in Creative and Programming Work

Dear friends, family, and colleagues,

We're living through a big shift, one that reminds me of the industrial revolutions we learned about in school—the ones that brought us steam engines, electricity, and the internet. This time, it's AI. Like those revolutions before it, this one is shaking things up and making us think hard about how we work, what we create, and where we go from here.

AI, especially generative AI, is just a tool. Think of it like a hammer. In the right hands, it can build amazing things. Used carelessly, it can do damage. And if someone picks it up with the wrong intentions, it can be harmful. The tool itself isn't good or bad—it's all about how we choose to use it.

### What's AI Actually Doing?

AI is changing things for people like us—writers, artists, programmers, and creatives. It can write code, draw pictures, and even come up with ideas. But here's the thing: AI doesn't invent or imagine. It works by remixing what it's been taught, which comes from people—our work, our ideas, our creativity. It's clever, but it doesn't have that spark of originality that makes something truly special.

For programmers, AI can help with tedious stuff—debugging code, automating tasks, or speeding up boring bits. For creatives, it can help spark ideas or fill in gaps. But it's still up to us to take what it offers and turn it into something meaningful.

### Why It's OK to Feel Nervous

Change is scary, and I get why people worry about AI. Some fear it'll replace jobs, devalue our work, or take the heart out of creativity. But let's be real: we've had these worries before. Machines didn't replace people during the industrial revolutions—they changed what we did and how we did it. AI isn't replacing creativity or problem-solving; it's giving us new ways to do those things.

Still, we've got to be careful. If we lean on AI too much, we might lose the very things that make our work unique. And we can't ignore the risks—bias in AI, ethical concerns, or people using it to cut corners.

### Where Do We Go From Here?

Here's what I believe: AI should help us, not take over. It should free us from the dull stuff so we can focus on what matters—bringing ideas to life, solving tricky problems, and creating things that make people stop and think.

To make that happen, we all have a part to play:

- Let's use AI responsibly. It's here to help, not replace.
- Let's keep learning and adapting. The world's changing, and so are the tools we use.
- Let's keep creating with heart, staying true to the things that make our work matter.

### A Final Thought

AI is just the next step in the journey. We've faced changes like this before, and we'll face them again. What matters is how we respond. If we see AI as a partner—not a threat—it can help us do amazing things. Let's use it wisely, make the most of its potential, and keep building a future where creativity thrives alongside technology.

Thanks for reading,
Luke
