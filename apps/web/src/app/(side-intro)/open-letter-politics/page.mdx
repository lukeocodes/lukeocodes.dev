## Politics

Dear friends, family, and colleagues,

Judging people based on their politics might seem harsh, but it's important to understand that politics isn't just about abstract ideas or differing opinions—it's about real-life consequences. When someone supports a political figure or movement that promotes racism, bigotry, or denies women the right to make decisions about their own bodies, it's not simply a “difference in views.” It reflects what they're willing to accept in our society.

Politics shapes people's safety, rights, and dignity. Supporting harmful ideologies or leaders has a direct impact on those who are most vulnerable. Ignoring that damage isn't neutral—it's enabling. Drawing a line and saying, “This is not okay,” isn't about division; it's about standing up for a kinder, fairer society where everyone's humanity is respected.

### The 2024 U.S. Election and the Battle for Democracy

The potential return of Donald Trump as President in 2024 is a pivotal moment, not just for the United States but for global democracy. While our grandparents and great-grandparents fought for the freedom to vote for leaders of our choosing, that freedom only holds value when it's informed and protected from manipulation. Voting is a cornerstone of democracy, but democracy also relies on fair and honest communication of ideas.

The manipulation of media, particularly through Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter, represents a stark threat to democratic principles. By fostering an environment where misinformation and political agendas dominate public discourse, platforms like Twitter can distort facts to serve those in power. This isn't democracy; it's a calculated abuse of influence that undermines the integrity of free choice. A democracy thrives on informed voters, and when powerful entities twist narratives to serve their own ends, they chip away at the very freedoms they claim to uphold.

### Understanding Political Ideologies: A Spectrum of Values

Politics is complex, and not all disagreements come from the same moral or ethical foundation. There's a critical difference between socialism, liberalism, conservatism, and— for lack of a better term—fascism. Each represents a distinct set of values:

- **Socialism** emphasizes collective welfare, focusing on reducing inequality and providing universal access to essentials like healthcare and education.
- **Liberalism** champions individual freedoms, equal rights, and democratic governance, balancing personal liberty with societal responsibility.
- **Conservatism** values tradition, stability, and gradual change, often emphasizing personal responsibility and free markets.
- **Fascism**, however, is fundamentally different. It thrives on authoritarian control, nationalism, and the suppression of dissent, often using fear and division as tools of power.

While healthy debate between socialism, liberalism, and conservatism can strengthen a democracy, the rise of fascism or authoritarianism represents a direct threat to it. Recognizing these distinctions is critical to understanding what we're voting for and the potential consequences of our choices.

Raising my daughter and my disabled son has profoundly changed how I see the world. My son, who is non-verbal and has significant learning challenges, and my daughter, with her own unique needs, face a future influenced by how society chooses to treat them and others like them. Their experiences have taught me empathy and compassion in ways I never fully understood before. They've shown me the importance of protecting the rights of those who may not have the power to protect themselves. I want them to grow up in a world where kindness, respect, and fairness are fundamental—where they are valued for who they are, no conditions attached.

If that makes me “woke,” so be it. You won't change my mind. While my opinions on many things are strong but loosely held, this is one conviction I will never compromise on.

Thanks for reading,
Luke
