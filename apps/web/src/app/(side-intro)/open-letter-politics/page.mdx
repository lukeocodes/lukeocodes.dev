## Politics

An open letter to friends, family, and colleagues.

Judging people based on their politics can feel a bit harsh, but it's important to remember that politics isn't just about different opinions. It's about real-life consequences for people. If someone supports a political figure known for racism, bigotry, or taking away women's rights to make choices about their own bodies, that's not just a “difference in views.” It says something about what they're okay with allowing in our society.

Politics impacts how safe people feel, who gets to keep their rights, and who's treated with respect. When someone backs harmful ideas or people, we can't ignore the damage those ideas do. Drawing a line and saying, “That's not okay,” is about protecting everyone's right to dignity and respect. Judging someone for supporting harmful politics isn't the same as dismissing them—it's standing up for a fairer, kinder society.

Raising a daughter and a disabled son has given me a completely different view of life. My son, who is non-verbal and has significant learning challenges, and my young daughter both have unique needs and face a future shaped by how society treats them and others like them. Their experiences have taught me empathy and compassion on a level I hadn't understood before, and they've shown me how crucial it is to protect the rights of those who might not be able to protect themselves. I want them to grow up in a world where kindness, respect, and fairness are non-negotiable, where they are valued simply for who they are.

Call me "woke," but you'll never change my mind on this. My opinions might usually be strong but weakly held, but this is one thing I'll never move on.
