## Introduction

Welcome to my user manual. This document outlines my personal and professional values, communication preferences, and how best to work with me. It is intended to foster understanding and collaboration.

> Caveats: This is my user manual. Just because something works for me, do not assume every person with ADHD will feel the same.

## About me

I'm a parent of two and a partner to one kind and supportive wife. Everything I do, my career, my hobbies, my relationships, my life, is done with my family in mind.

My kids are my world. One is has autism, pica and a global development imparement. The other is becoming the worlds most comfident (and dramatic) little girl. I love being a dad, a girl dad especially, and talking about my kids.

I especially love talking about how navigating our unique circumstances has shaped my life and my career, making me a better person and colleague.

## How my values shaped my professional life

I was raised in Cyncoed, Cardiff, a multicultural area. Almost all of my childhood friends were from diverse backgrounds. Their cultures had a significant impact on me.

One of my favourite memories is of dinner with friends. I learned things like; we eat with our right hand, because the devil eats with his left. These meals were more than just food too, they were lessons in tradition and respect.

I remember learning about the Cherry Blossom Festival and the welcoming of spring. Spring in Wales is particularly special, as the national flower – the daffodil – blooms in the spring. And, to this day, daffodils popping out of the soil always put a smile on my face. Another thing I remember learning was that my friends didn't need to fast when his parents did – for Ramadan – because they were kids! But, they were very involved in charity work during Ramadan. Their dedication to helping others made a strong impression on me.

### Opposed to bigotry and prejudice

Growing up in such a diverse area taught me to appreciate how differences can bring us closer together. Simply saying we're "all the same" overlooks our unique experiences, both good and bad. This understanding is why I am strongly opposed to all forms of bigotry and prejudice.

I am deeply affected by past experiences, particularly by suppressed childhood trauma which has resurfaced in the last few years. I spent time as both an Army Reserve and a Reserve Police Officer over a course of 10 years. I worked hard in both roles, around my career, but remain strongly opposed to many forms of policing and military applications in use in the world today. Times, as they say, have changed.

I am very open-minded and have a strong sense of justice, empathy, and compassion (which may stereotypically be attributed to ADHD, among my other experiences). I am also very willing to listen to others, especially if they are in need.

My experiences have had a big impact on me, and as a result:

- I will not stand for bigotry of any kind.

> "I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented." - [Elie Wiesel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1986/wiesel/acceptance-speech/)

- I will recuse myself from any project supporting direct military and/or law enforcement agencies.

- I do not shy away from conflict.

- I value respect and team spirit highly, and despise deceitful or duplicitous actions.

- I am protective of my colleagues.

## My parents

My mum is the eldest of five children, and grew up in a working-class background in Dagenham, Essex (England). She sacrificed her education to help support her family, also helping to raise her younger siblings.

Later, she became the sole earner in our own family after my dad was involved in a serious car accident leaving him partially paralysed.

She worked tirelessly to keep a roof over our heads. I witnessed her immense dedication and hard work. This was all while my dad struggled with PTSD and depression, and later what I suspect to be an undiagnosed opioid addiction.

Her hard work was a constant source of inspiration to me. The following are some of the lessons I learned from her:

- I value effort first over effectiveness, and patience over perfection.

- I treat others how I want to be treated, and I judge a person more by how they treat the people below them, than above them.

- I take pride in my achievements, but I prefer to celebrate the achievements of others.

## I am a walking contradiction

I have been diagnosed with [ADHD](https://findyourspark.co.uk/how-do-you-explain-adhd-to-someone-who-doesnt-have-it/) Type-C (aka [Combined Type](https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/)) and [cPTSD](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-and-complex-ptsd/complex-ptsd/).

ADHD, often misunderstood as solely a mental health issue, is more accurately classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand just how much of an impact it has had on my life, personality, and professional life.

I have written more about [ADHD and cPTSD](#more-on-adhd-and-cptsd) at the end of this page.

- I am [a Starter, not a Finisher](https://blog.andyet.com/2018/07/10/starters-finishers-and-large-teams/). I thrive on creating POCs _fast_, generating ideas, and developing creative solutions to tricky problems.

- I am both a perfectionist and a pragmatist. I can often recognise when "good" is good enough, but I can get hyper-focused on small details such as code quality and best practices.

- I am [calm amongst chaos](https://www.additudemag.com/benefits-of-adhd-crisis/). In times of crisis, I can take in a lot of information, filter out what is most important, create a plan, and act decisively.

- Sometimes my output may seem like feast or famine. When I find a project interesting, it is easier for me to focus (or [hyperfocus](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/)). If I have a prolonged period with lower than usual output, I am probably struggling with a project I have no interest in, but I&apos;m too ashamed to ask for help.

- I like to solve problems. I will gravitate towards things that can be fixed, decided, or eliminated, even if they are not my responsibility.

- I am an [ambivert](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-ambivert), but I am often mistaken for an extrovert (especially in a remote-work environment). I'm much more inclined to be introverted, but amongst friends or trusted colleagues, I will often position myself in the centre of the conversation. In new situations, or situations I feel uncomfortable, [I tend to withdraw.](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-adhd-emotional-dysregulation)

- I approach new relationships with a shy respect, authenticity, and open-mindedness, expecting at least the same in return.

- I know myself well. I know my strengths and my weaknesses, and I am honest and transparent about both.

## What I don&apos;t have patience for

- Deceitfulness. I have no respect or time for two-faced people.

- People who do not consider the impact of their actions on others. That does not mean that their every action must be positive, but it should be thoughtful, considerate, and empathetic.

- Micromanaging; this is usually a symptom of a more significant issue.

- Managers who have read a misguided "How To Manage Employees With ADHD" articles. If you'd like advice on supporting me, please just ask – I will share better articles than those.

- Leadership which (when appropriate) does not invite or accept input when deciding on a course of action that directly impacts me or my team (aka "Decrees from on high").

## How to best communicate with me

- Feel free to message me anytime, but please note I may not respond immediately due to time zone differences (I'm in the UK).

- Despite working in AI, I despise copy-pasting from an LLM.

- Just ask your questions directly; no need for formalities.

- I prefer friendly and straightforward communication.

- Feedback is welcome, especially when it's actionable.

- If plans change, a quick DM is appreciated.

- If I seem distracted, a follow-up message helps ensure I don't miss anything important.

- I value efficient meetings and appreciate tools that enhance understanding and context, like AI-powered meeting notes.

- I LOVE it when people follow a meeting with a DM recapping what we discussed and what actions I need to take.

## What are my blind spots?

- Anything which is not interesting (sorry). For example, I really struggle with administrative tasks, and anything that is not directly related to my work. I love my job and my career, and it's that excitement (and the dopamine–see ADHD) which makes me driven, focused, fast and productive.

- Things that are out-of-sight [may cease to exist for me](https://medium.com/fourth-wave/making-object-permanence-disappear-from-the-adhd-discussion-78c630741aab). If you ask me a question in chat and I do not respond, please give me a gentle nudge. If I became distracted after reading your message I may have forgotten to reply.

- Time keeping - I [perceive time differently](https://www.additudemag.com/time-blindness-running-late-adhd) from someone who is neurotypical. If I'm 5-minutes late, I will always respect a little nudge in a DM.

## How to help me

- Give me large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus (easier if you're on the West Coast, because I'm in the UK).

- Keep process and admin to a minimum.

- Play into my strengths: ask for my input or ideas on everything, allow me to work on topics I&apos;m curious about, let me be self-directing.

- If something has a strict deadline, schedule frequent check-ins first thing in the morning to help me stay focused and be pragmatic.

## What people misunderstand about me

- I can be very blunt and direct in my communication, which is easy to misconstrue as frustration or anger (it is not).

- I have strong beliefs, weakly held. Just because I am arguing for something with conviction does not mean I am not receptive to counter-arguments. I welcome healthy debate and constructive criticism, but not [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).

- I have a [strong sense of justice](https://www.additudemag.com/why-am-i-so-sensitive-adhd-in-adults/), and have been known to struggle to just "let it go" when someone has not considered the impact of their actions on others - especially on my team.

## More on ADHD and cPTSD

**ADHD** is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting attention, impulse control, and activity levels from early childhood. It's often misunderstood as a mental health issue, but it involves brain development differences. Despite misconceptions, people with ADHD often have unique strengths such as creativity, hyperfocus, compassion, and humor.

**cPTSD** results from prolonged exposure to traumatic events. It leads to hypervigilance and emotional dysregulation, affecting communication and stress reactions. People with cPTSD may perceive feedback as personal attacks, have self-esteem issues, and exhibit exaggerated stress responses.

The combination of ADHD and cPTSD can make it difficult to manage stress, relationships, and work. I have found strategies that work for me, and help me to function well at home and work. I am always happy to share them with others who may be struggling with dysregulation, stress, or anxiety.

### Working and Communicating

To support individuals with ADHD and cPTSD, consider these tips:

- Practice active listening. Asking someone with ADHD to repeat themselves after they've had to work harder to stay focussed on what you've said is disrespectful and could be perceived as rejection.

- Break down instructions into simple steps, as ADHD is associated with a lower capacity for working memory, which is the part of the brain that holds information long enough to be processed into tasks.

- Help create a predictable setting and avoid surprises. People with ADHD and cPTSD may struggle with sudden changes or unexpected events, no matter how small. They may be surprisingly effective in a crisis, but struggle with the smallest change in day-to-day routine.

- Accommodate unique working styles that may support coping strategies. Remote working is a great example of a strategy that can enhance productivity, welling and a control over routine, while in-person working can enhance social interaction and a sense of belonging. Everyone is different.

- Celebrate their achievements because they will only celebrate those of others. They may not see their own achievements as significant, so it's important to acknowledge their hard work and accomplishments.

- Provide clear, specific, and actionable feedback.
