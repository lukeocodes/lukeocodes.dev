## User Manual

> Caveats: This is my user manual. Just because something works for me, do not assume every person with ADHD will feel the same.

I have been diagnosed with [ADHD](https://findyourspark.co.uk/how-do-you-explain-adhd-to-someone-who-doesnt-have-it/) Type-C (aka [Combined Type](https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/)) and [cPTSD](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-and-complex-ptsd/complex-ptsd/).

ADHD, often misunderstood as solely a mental health issue, is more accurately classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Through recent diagnosis (last couple of years) and support I have sought, I have been able to become more aware of my super powers and how to use them to my advantage. I've written more about [ADHD and cPTSD](#more-on-adhd-and-cptsd) at the end of this page.

I'm a parent of two. One is has autism and developmental impairment, and the other is just a very demanding 3 year old. I love being a dad, a girl dad, and talking about my kids. I especially love talking about how navigating our unique circumstances has shaped my life and my career, making me a better person and colleague.

## How my values shaped my professional life

I was raised in Wales in a very multi-cultural area. Almost all of my very-young childhood friends were non-White, with my closest two friends being Chinese and Iranian. We all grew up sharing meals in each of our homes, and am very grateful for the opportunities I had at a young age to learn from their cultures; like why you eat with your right hand (it's not what you think).

I'm deeply affected by past experiences, particularly by suppressed trauma which has resurfaced in the last few years. Trauma can be described as the brain's survival-mode, often supressing things which only resurface when similar events occur later in life. To understand this better, a kind colleague (and separately, my psychologist) recommended the book [The Body Remembers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Body-Remembers-Psychophysiology-Treatment-Professional/dp/0393703274). If you're struggling with early-life trauma, I recommend it. But, always seek support when you need it.

I am very open-minded and have a strong sense of justice, empathy and compassion. I am also very willing to listen to others, especially if they are in need. My experiences have had a big impact on me, and as a result:

- I will not stand for bigotry of any kind.

> "I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere." - [Auschwitz survivor. Human rights activist. Elie Wiesel, at his Nobel Prize acceptance speech](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1986/wiesel/acceptance-speech/)

- I will not recuse myself from any project supporting direct or indirect military or law enforcement applications.

- I do not shy away from conflict, and I am likely to be vocal when I disagree with a course of action.

- I value respect and camaraderie highly and despise deceitful or duplicitous actions.

- I am protective of my team.

My mum came from a very working-class background. She sacrificed a lot of her education to support her parents, and later was the sole earner in our household striving to keep a roof over our head. This, while my dad suffered the impacts of severe PTSD and depression following a car accident, and later what I expect to be an undiagnosed opioid addiction. The effects of this are evident in my professional life:

- I value effort over effectiveness, and patience over perfection.

- I judge a person more by how they treat the people below them, than above them.  

> "a man&apos;s true claim to refinement of character and good sense, is better tested by scarcely any social incident, than by the way he treats his inferiors in life. Nothing shows a greater abjectness of spirit than an overbearing temper. To insult or to abuse those who cannot resist, or dare not resent the injury, is a sure mark of cowardice" — Courtesy to Inferiors, 1852  

- I take pride in my achievements and the achievements of others, and I like to celebrate them.

## I am a walking contradiction

- I am [a Starter, not a Finisher](https://blog.andyet.com/2018/07/10/starters-finishers-and-large-teams/). I thrive on creating POCs _fast_, generating ideas, and developing creative solutions to tricky problems.

- I am both a perfectionist and a pragmatist. I can often recognise when “good” is good enough, but I can get hyper-focused on small details such as code quality and best practices.

- I am [calm amongst chaos](https://www.additudemag.com/benefits-of-adhd-crisis/). In times of crisis, I can take in a lot of information, filter out what is most important, create a plan, and act decisively.

- Sometimes my output may seem like feast or famine. When I find a project interesting, it is easier for me to focus (or [hyperfocus](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/)). If I have a prolonged period with lower than usual output, I am probably struggling with a project I have no interest in, but I&apos;m too ashamed to ask for help.

- I like to solve problems. I will gravitate towards things that can be fixed, decided, or eliminated, even if they are not my responsibility.

- I am an [ambivert](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-ambivert), but I am often mistaken for an extrovert. I'm much more inclined to be introverted, but amongst friends or trusted colleagues, I will often position myself in the centre of the conversation. In new situations, or situations I feel uncomfortable, [I tend to withdraw.](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/more-than-thin-skinned-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-1130197#:~:text=With%20high%2Danxiety,again%20and%20again)

- I approach new relationships with respect, authenticity, and open-mindedness, expecting the same in return.

- I know myself well. I know my strengths and my weaknesses, and I am honest and transparent about both.

## What I don&apos;t have patience for

- Deceitfulness. I have no respect or time for two-faced people.

- People who do not consider the impact of their actions on others. That does not mean that their every action must be positive, but it should be thoughtful, considerate, and empathetic.

- Micromanaging; this is usually a symptom of a more significant issue or a manager who has read a misguided “How To Manage Employees With ADHD” article. If you'd like advice on supporting me, please just ask.

- Leadership which (when appropriate) does not invite or accept input when deciding on a course of action that directly impacts me or my team (aka "Decrees from on high").

## How to best communicate with me

- Instant Message/Chat, but with an understanding that it is async and I may not respond right away. I am also in the UK, which may not be the same time zone as you.

- [Don't ask to ask, just ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/)

- [No hello.](https://nohello.net/)

- I prefer communication which is human! Feel free to be familiar, friendly and colloquial.

- I enjoy just chatting, but not as an avoidance. If we need to talk about something, just get to it.

- Direct communication. If something is for me, discuss it with me. Do not try to generalize a message to the team, hoping I will understand it.

- If you need to book a meeting I prefer as early as possible in our shared overlapping work hours.

- Give meetings descriptive titles and please include an agenda. 

- [Please, no "Need to chat".](https://medium.com/@merrylue/5-ways-leaders-can-avoid-sending-toxic-messages-to-employees-dc015698499c)

- If you’re inviting me to a meeting on short notice or cancelling/rescheduling an existing meeting, DM me and let me know.

- If you are talking to me while I am focused on something else, even if I am responding and actively participating in the conversation, it is unlikely that I will remember anything about the conversation afterwards.

- If you suspect I was distracted during a conversation, send a DM later recapping what we discussed and what actions you require from me.

- I encourage the use of "smart minutes" in meetings, especially ones with an LLM behind them that can be queried for more context/information from the transcript - this includes 1:1s.

## What are my blind spots?

- Anything which is not interesting. For example, I really struggle with administrative tasks, and anything that is not directly related to my work.

- Things that are out-of-sight [may cease to exist for me](https://medium.com/fourth-wave/making-object-permanence-disappear-from-the-adhd-discussion-78c630741aab). If you ask me a question in chat and I do not respond, please give me a gentle nudge. If I became distracted after reading your message I may have forgotten to reply.

- Time keeping - I [perceive time differently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6556068/) from someone who is neurotypical. If I'm 5-minutes late, I will always respect a little nudge in a DM.

## How to help me

- Give me large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus.

- Keep process and admin to a minimum.

- Play into my strengths: ask for my input or ideas on everything, allow me to work on topics I&apos;m curious about, let me be self-directing.

- If something has a strict deadline, schedule frequent check-ins first thing in the morning to help me stay focused and be pragmatic.

## What people misunderstand about me

- I can be very blunt and direct in my communication, which is easy to misconstrue as frustration or anger (it is not).

- I have strong beliefs, weakly held. Just because I am arguing for something with conviction does not mean I am not receptive to counter-arguments. I welcome healthy debate and constructive criticism, but not [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).

- I have a [strong sense of justice](https://www.additudemag.com/why-am-i-so-sensitive-adhd-in-adults/), and have been known to just "let it go" when someone has not considered the impact of their actions on others - especially my team.

## More on ADHD and cPTSD

ADHD, often misunderstood as solely a mental health issue, is more accurately classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder. This distinction is crucial for appreciating its complex impact on individuals' lives. Unlike mental health disorders, ADHD involves differences in brain development affecting attention, impulse control, and activity levels from early childhood onwards.

I dislike the common trope that "everyone seems to have it these days", as adult ADHD has only been recognised in the UK since 2008, and only had a diagnostic route since 2020! Before 2008, it was strictly seen as a childhood disorder, resulting in the vast knowledge of ADHD being limited to paediatric doctors and psychiatrists.

> There are still many misconceptions about ADHD. One of these is that having ADHD means you don’t have enough attention and therefore are unable to concentrate.  The fact is people with ADHD have TOO much attention and notice EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE.

Focussing on the positives, people with ADHD often have very specific super powers:

- Creativity: They may have unique problem-solving abilities and think outside the box, because their brains simply work differently to most other people.
- Hyperfocus: When interested, they can concentrate intensely on tasks, often leading to deep dives into subjects of interest.
- Compassionate: They are often compassionate and empathetic, and feel an innate need help others around them, in work or in life.
- Humerous: They are generally quick-witted and enjoy making others laugh. Their spontaneous nature and unique perspective on situations can lead to very funny situations.
