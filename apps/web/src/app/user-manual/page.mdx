## User Manual

> Caveats: This is my user manual. Just because something works for me, do not assume every person with ADHD will feel the same.

I have been diagnosed with [ADHD](https://findyourspark.co.uk/how-do-you-explain-adhd-to-someone-who-doesnt-have-it/) Type-C (aka [Combined Type](https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/)) and [cPTSD](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-and-complex-ptsd/complex-ptsd/).

ADHD, often misunderstood as solely a mental health issue, is more accurately classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Through recent diagnosis (last couple of years) and support I have sought, I have been able to become more aware of my super powers and how to use them to my advantage. I've written more about [ADHD and cPTSD](#more-on-adhd-and-cptsd) at the end of this page.

I'm a parent of two. One is has autism and has a learning disability, and the other is just a very demanding 3 year old. I love being a dad, a girl dad, and talking about my kids. I especially love talking about how navigating our unique circumstances has shaped my life and my career, making me a better person and colleague.

## How my values shaped my professional life

I was raised in Cyncoed, Cardiff, a very multicultural area. Almost all of my childhood friends were non-White, including my two closest friends. This diversity had a big impact on me.

One of my best memories is sharing meals with friends from different backgrounds. I learned why we eat with our right hand, as the devil eats with his left. These meals were more than just food; they were lessons in tradition and respect.

I remember learning about the Cherry Blossom Festival and the welcoming of spring. Another friend explained that while they didn't need to fast for Ramadan because they were younger, their parents did and were very involved in charity work during this time. Their dedication to helping others made a strong impression on me.

Growing up in such a diverse area taught me to appreciate how differences can bring us closer together. Simply saying we're "all the same" overlooks our unique experiences, both good and bad. This understanding is why I am strongly anti-racist.

Sadly, I am deeply affected by past experiences, particularly by suppressed trauma which has resurfaced in the last few years. Trauma can be described as the brain's survival-mode, often supressing things which only resurface when similar events occur later in life.

I am very open-minded and have a strong sense of justice, empathy, and compassion. I am also very willing to listen to others, especially if they are in need. My experiences have had a big impact on me, and as a result:

- I will not stand for bigotry of any kind.

> "I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere." - [Auschwitz survivor. Human rights activist. Elie Wiesel, at his Nobel Prize acceptance speech](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1986/wiesel/acceptance-speech/)

- I will recuse myself from any project supporting direct military and/or law enforcement applications.

- I do not shy away from conflict.

- I value respect and team spirit highly, and despise deceitful or duplicitous actions.

- I am protective of my colleagues.

My mum is the eldest of five children, and grew up in a working-class background in Dagenham, Essex (England). She sacrificed her education to help support her family, also helping to raise her younger siblings. Later, she became the sole earner in our own family after my dad was involved in a car accident. She working tirelessly to keep a roof over our heads. I witnessed her immense dedication and hard work. This was all while my dad struggled with PTSD and depression following the accident, and later what I still suspect to be an undiagnosed opioid addiction. The impact of these experiences is evident in my professional life:

- I value effort first over effectiveness, and patience over perfection.

- I judge a person more by how they treat the people below them, than above them.

> "a man&apos;s true claim to refinement of character and good sense, is better tested by scarcely any social incident, than by the way he treats his inferiors in life. Nothing shows a greater abjectness of spirit than an overbearing temper. To insult or to abuse those who cannot resist, or dare not resent the injury, is a sure mark of cowardice" — Courtesy to Inferiors, 1852

- I take pride in my achievements and the achievements of others, and I like to celebrate them.

## I am a walking contradiction

- I am [a Starter, not a Finisher](https://blog.andyet.com/2018/07/10/starters-finishers-and-large-teams/). I thrive on creating POCs _fast_, generating ideas, and developing creative solutions to tricky problems.

- I am both a perfectionist and a pragmatist. I can often recognise when “good” is good enough, but I can get hyper-focused on small details such as code quality and best practices.

- I am [calm amongst chaos](https://www.additudemag.com/benefits-of-adhd-crisis/). In times of crisis, I can take in a lot of information, filter out what is most important, create a plan, and act decisively.

- Sometimes my output may seem like feast or famine. When I find a project interesting, it is easier for me to focus (or [hyperfocus](https://www.additudemag.com/understanding-adhd-hyperfocus/)). If I have a prolonged period with lower than usual output, I am probably struggling with a project I have no interest in, but I&apos;m too ashamed to ask for help.

- I like to solve problems. I will gravitate towards things that can be fixed, decided, or eliminated, even if they are not my responsibility.

- I am an [ambivert](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-ambivert), but I am often mistaken for an extrovert (especially in a remote-work environment). I'm much more inclined to be introverted, but amongst friends or trusted colleagues, I will often position myself in the centre of the conversation. In new situations, or situations I feel uncomfortable, [I tend to withdraw.](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/more-than-thin-skinned-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-1130197#:~:text=With%20high%2Danxiety,again%20and%20again)

- I approach new relationships with a shy respect, authenticity, and open-mindedness, expecting at least the same in return.

- I know myself well. I know my strengths and my weaknesses, and I am honest and transparent about both.

## What I don&apos;t have patience for

- Deceitfulness. I have no respect or time for two-faced people.

- People who do not consider the impact of their actions on others. That does not mean that their every action must be positive, but it should be thoughtful, considerate, and empathetic.

- Micromanaging; this is usually a symptom of a more significant issue or a manager who has read a misguided “How To Manage Employees With ADHD” article. If you'd like advice on supporting me, please just ask.

- Leadership which (when appropriate) does not invite or accept input when deciding on a course of action that directly impacts me or my team (aka "Decrees from on high").

## How to best communicate with me

- Instant Message/Chat, but with an understanding that it is async and I may not respond right away. I am also in the UK, which may not be the same time zone as you.

- [Don't ask to ask, just ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/)

- [No hello.](https://nohello.net/)

- I prefer communication which is human! Feel free to be familiar, friendly and colloquial.

- I appreciate feedback, but dislike surprises. I'd prefer to wait for a 1:1 to recieve the feedback, and I need it to be clearly actionable.

- I enjoy just chatting, but not as an avoidance. If we need to talk about something, just get to it.

- Direct communication. If something is for me, discuss it with me. Do not try to generalize a message to the team, hoping I will understand it.

- If you need to book a meeting I prefer as early as possible in our shared overlapping work hours.

- Give meetings descriptive titles and please include an agenda.

- [Please, no "Need to chat".](https://medium.com/@merrylue/5-ways-leaders-can-avoid-sending-toxic-messages-to-employees-dc015698499c)

- If you’re inviting me to a meeting on short notice or cancelling/rescheduling an existing meeting, DM me and let me know.

- If you are talking to me while I am focused on something else, even if I am responding and actively participating in the conversation, it is unlikely that I will remember anything about the conversation afterwards.

- If you suspect I was distracted during a conversation, send a DM later recapping what we discussed and what actions you require from me.

- I encourage the use of "smart minutes" in meetings, especially ones with an LLM behind them that can be queried for more context/information from the transcript - this includes 1:1s.

## What are my blind spots?

- Anything which is not interesting. For example, I really struggle with administrative tasks, and anything that is not directly related to my work.

- Things that are out-of-sight [may cease to exist for me](https://medium.com/fourth-wave/making-object-permanence-disappear-from-the-adhd-discussion-78c630741aab). If you ask me a question in chat and I do not respond, please give me a gentle nudge. If I became distracted after reading your message I may have forgotten to reply.

- Time keeping - I [perceive time differently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6556068/) from someone who is neurotypical. If I'm 5-minutes late, I will always respect a little nudge in a DM.

## How to help me

- Give me large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus.

- Keep process and admin to a minimum.

- Play into my strengths: ask for my input or ideas on everything, allow me to work on topics I&apos;m curious about, let me be self-directing.

- If something has a strict deadline, schedule frequent check-ins first thing in the morning to help me stay focused and be pragmatic.

## What people misunderstand about me

- I can be very blunt and direct in my communication, which is easy to misconstrue as frustration or anger (it is not).

- I have strong beliefs, weakly held. Just because I am arguing for something with conviction does not mean I am not receptive to counter-arguments. I welcome healthy debate and constructive criticism, but not [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).

- I have a [strong sense of justice](https://www.additudemag.com/why-am-i-so-sensitive-adhd-in-adults/), and have been known to struggle to just "let it go" when someone has not considered the impact of their actions on others - especially on my team.

## More on ADHD and cPTSD

**ADHD** is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting attention, impulse control, and activity levels from early childhood. It's often misunderstood as a mental health issue, but it involves brain development differences. Despite misconceptions, people with ADHD often have unique strengths such as creativity, hyperfocus, compassion, and humor.

**cPTSD** results from prolonged exposure to traumatic events. It leads to hypervigilance and emotional dysregulation, affecting communication and stress reactions. People with cPTSD may perceive feedback as personal attacks, have self-esteem issues, and exhibit exaggerated stress responses.

### Working and Communicating

To support individuals with ADHD and cPTSD, consider these tips:

- **Clear and Concise Communication**: Break down instructions into simple steps and use visual aids.
- **Safe and Supportive Environment**: Ensure a calm, predictable setting with minimal distractions.
- **Flexibility and Understanding**: Allow flexible hours, respect boundaries, and accommodate unique working styles.
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Recognize and celebrate achievements to boost self-esteem, often.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide clear, specific, and actionable feedback.
- **Active Listening and Empathy**: Practice active listening and validate their feelings without judgment.

Implementing these strategies can create an inclusive and supportive environment, helping individuals with ADHD and cPTSD thrive.
